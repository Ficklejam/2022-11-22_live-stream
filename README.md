# ðŸ§ªIdeas...
Request!!! Please! Add a step. Tell the group about yourself.  Nark it with an emoji. Explain that emoji. I'll use ðŸŽ¯ with mine to show where I think things should go. Maybe ðŸ§ª for ideas..., and ðŸš© for the place things should get done next.

The ðŸ“º means that on Tuesday, November 22, 2022 there will be a live stream on Zoom!
